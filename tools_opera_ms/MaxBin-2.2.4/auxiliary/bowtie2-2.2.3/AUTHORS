The ForkManager.pm perl module is used in Bowtie 2's random testing framework,
and is included as scripts/sim/contrib/ForkManager.pm.  ForkManager.pm is
written by dLux (Szabo, Balazs), with contributions by others.  See the perldoc
in ForkManager.pm for the complete list.

The file ls.h includes an implementation of the Larsson-Sadakane suffix sorting
algorithm.  The implementation is by N. Jesper Larsson and was adapted somewhat
for use in Bowtie 2.
